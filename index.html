      <h2>PROFESSIONAL SURFER</h2>
      <p>Rob Machado is not just one of the world’s greatest surfers, he’s also one of the sport’s most recognizable characters -- a living icon who continues to expand the definition of what professional surfing is all about. Known for his zen-like flow both on land and in the water, Machado was consistently seeded at the top of the rankings as a competitor on the ASP World Tour. With 12 career WCT victories, Machado was ranked among the top ten surfers for eleven straight years and was inducted into the Surfer’s Hall of Fame in 2000 and re-inducted in 2006 and SIMA Waterman of the Year in 2011.</p>
      <h2>HUMANITARIAN</h2>
      <p>Rob launched the Rob Machado Foundation (RMF) in 2004 and never looked back. Today RMF provides clean drinking water stations and water bottles to thousands of kids across California and Hawaii. Additionally the foundation has supported local gardening programs and hosted dozens of beach cleanups. See more on RMF <a id="instagram-link" href="" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.robmachadofoundation.org/new-index">The Rob Machado foundation started in 2004 and our main objective from day one was to just connect with kids and bring environmental education into their lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        In a perfect world I would love to see every kid coming to school with a reusable water bottle, they’re using it at school, they got a refill station they get to go home maybe give their parents a little grief — like hey why don’t you have one?
        <br>
        <br>
        Creating that perfect little ecosystem that they’re just comfortable with it, it becomes part of their life.”

      <h2>SHAPER</h2>
      <p>Hey my name is Rob Machado, stoked you're here and that we're able to share the stoke. Ever since coming off tour I have found pleasure in the simple things like riding fun boards with great people in beautiful places. Here at "Rob Machado Surfboards," you will find an array of my favorite shapes. Most of my boards are made from epoxy foam and glassed with e-polly resin. With the help from my sponsor, Firewire I have been able to continue to be a professional surfer and now a shaper / designer. All "Rob Machado Surfboards," are hand touched by me personally. I hope you find one or a few you enjoy, I am pleased to be able to create these fun sleds and share the stoke. </p>
